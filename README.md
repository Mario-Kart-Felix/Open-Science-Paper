Open-Science-Paper
==================

This repository contains a LaTeX document with a two column layout for open
science collaborative paper writing. The layout is close to common papers which
helps to prepare the data for publication. The document combines the LaTeX
typesetting capabilities with the power of the statistic programming language R
using the Knitr package. This enables the advantage of reproducible research by
an executable document.
