## About

### Description

This repository contains a LaTeX document which can be used for
scientific collaborative paper writing on GitHub. The layout of
the document is close to common scientific paper formats. For an
example see the PDF file in the repository or the documentation in the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki). The layout can help
to prepare figures and tables for publication. But you can also simply use the
document to produce nice looking, paper like formatted documents.

The Open-Science-Paper combines the LaTeX typesetting capabilities
with the power of the R programming language for statistics, using the
[Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. This combination enables
reproducible documents which enhances the reproducibility of your research. 

The Open-Science-Paper offers a clean folder structure for your paper. It comes
with example data for typical things required to typeset the paper and with a
makefile which helps you to compile, clean and archive the document.

Your can find the documentation of the Open-Science-Paper in the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki) of this GitHub
repository. It covers information about how to get started with the document,
collaborative paper writing on GitHub and a detailed documentation of all the
files contained in the Open-Science-Paper repository.
