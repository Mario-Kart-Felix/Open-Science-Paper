# About the Open-Science-Paper

This repository contains a LaTeX document which can be forked to use in
collaborative scientific paper writing with GitHub. The layout is close to
common paper formats (see PDF in repository) which helps you to prepare figures
and tables for publication. The document combines the LaTeX typesetting
capabilities with the power of R for statistic programming by using the Knitr
package (http://yihui.name/knitr/).

This combination has the advantage to enable a better reproducibility of your
research by creating executable documents which you can offer to others. The
Open-Science-Paper comes with some examples for typical things you need to
typeset like tables and plots (spanning one or two of the columns of the paper)
and much more. It also has a makefile which helps you to compile the LaTeX
document to get a PDF file.

The wiki of this repository contains informations about prerequisites to get
started with the document, a documentation about the file structure and the
contents of the Open-Science-Paper repository and a description of a workflow
for collaborative writing on GitHub using this document.
