## About Open-Science-Paper

This repository contains a LaTeX document which can used for scientific
collaborative paper writing on GitHub. The layout of the document is close to
common scientific paper formats (see PDF in repository) which helps you to
prepare figures and tables for publication. The Open-Science-Paper combines the
LaTeX typesetting capabilities with the power of R for statistic programming
using the Knitr package (http://yihui.name/knitr/).

This combination has the advantage to enable a better reproducibility of your
research creating executable documents which you can offer to others. The
document comes with some examples for typical things you need to typeset like
tables and plots (spanning one or two of the columns of the paper). A makefile
helps you to compile the LaTeX document to get a PDF of your paper.

The wiki of this repository contains information about prerequisites to get
started with the document, documentation about the folder structure and the
contents of the Open-Science-Paper repository and a description of a workflow
for collaborative writing on GitHub using this document.
