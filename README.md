# Open-Science-Paper

This repository contains a LaTeX document with a two column layout which
can be used for collaborative paper writing. The layout is close to
common paper formats which helps to prepare the figures and tables for
publication. The document combines the LaTeX typesetting capabilities with
the power of the statistic programming language R using the Knitr package
(http://yihui.name/knitr/). This combination has the advantage to enable better
reproducibility of your research offering executable documents to others.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this document a working installation of LaTeX is required.
Depending on your choice of LaTeX distribution and the type of installation
(full/subset), packages required for the document might have to be installed
additionally. Some LaTeX distributions (e.g MiKTeX, TeX Live) offer package
managers which help you with this task.

## Usage

The usage of this document with github for collaborative writing is easy and
requires only some small steps. Get a GitHub account and turn it into an
organization account under your account settings. You can now fork the document
to get your own copy of the Open-Science-Paper. After that you can checkout your
copy to a local repository and start writing and invite other researchers for
collaboration.
