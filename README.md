## About

### Description

This repository contains a LaTeX document which can be used for scientific
collaborative paper writing on GitHub. The layout of the document is close
to common scientific paper formats (see the PDF in repository or the the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki)) which helps you to
prepare figures and tables for publication or simple to produce nice looking,
paper like formatted documents.

The Open-Science-Paper combines LaTeX typesetting capabilities with the power
of R for statistic programming, using the [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
package. This combination gives you the advantage of better reproducibility of
your research, creating executable documents you can offer to other researchers.
The Open-Science-Paper offers a clean folder structure for your paper. It comes
with example data for typical things reqired to typeset the paper and with a
makefile which helps you to compile, clean and archive the document.

Your can find the documentation of the Open-Science-Paper in the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki) of the this GitHub
repository. It covers information about how to get started with the document,
collaborative writing on GitHub and a detailed documentation of all the
components contained in the Open-Science-Paper document.
