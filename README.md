## About

This repository contains a LaTeX document which can be used for scientific
collaborative paper writing on GitHub. The layout of the document is
close to common scientific paper formats (see PDF in repository or the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki) documentation) which
helps you to prepare figures and tables for publication or simple to produce
nice looking, paper like formatted documents. 

The Open-Science-Paper combines LaTeX typesetting capabilities with the power
of R for statistic programming using the [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
package. This combination gives you the advantage of better reproducibility of
your research, creating executable documents you can offer to other researchers.
The Open-Science-Paper comes with example data for typical things you need to
typeset like tables, figures in one and two column layout. The makefile of the
document assists you to compile the LaTeX code to PDF, archive your document and
much more.

Your can find documentation about the document in the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki) of the
Open-Science-Paper GitHub repository. It covers information about how to get
started with the document, collaborative writing on GitHub and a detailed
documentation of all the components contained in the Open-Science-Paper
document.
