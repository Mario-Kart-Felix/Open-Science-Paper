Open-Science-Paper
==================

This repository contains a LaTeX document with a two column layout which
can be used for collaborative paper writing. The layout is close to
common paper formats which helps to prepare the figures and tables for
publication. The document combines the LaTeX typesetting capabilities with
the power of the statistic programming language R using the Knitr package
(http://yihui.name/knitr/). This combination has the advantage of reproducible
research by an executable document.
