## About Open-Science-Paper

This repository contains a LaTeX document which can be used for scientific
collaborative paper writing on GitHub. The layout of the document is close to
common scientific paper formats (see PDF in repository) which helps you to
prepare figures and tables for publication or simple to produce nice looking
paper like documents. The Open-Science-Paper combines LaTeX typesetting
capabilities with the power of R for statistic programming using the Knitr
package (http://yihui.name/knitr/).

This combination gives you the advantage of better reproducibility of
your research, creating executable documents you can offer to others. The
Open-Science-Paper comes with example data for typical things you need to
typeset like tables and plots covering the cases of one and two column
overarching content. The makefile of the document assists you to compile the
LaTeX document to PDF, archive your document and with some other tasks.

The [wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Paper/wiki) of the
Open-Science-Paper can be found in the top menu bar of this repository. It
covers information about how to get started with the document, collaborative
writing on GitHub and a detailed documentation of all the components contained
in the Open-Science-Paper document.
